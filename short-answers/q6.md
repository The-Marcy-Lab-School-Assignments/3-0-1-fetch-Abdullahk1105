# Question

`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - This tells us if our request was successful and if not it also tells us why.

2. `Response.status` - This tells us the status code of the response, which can be all of these
   200 ,201 ,204, 404 , 500

3. `Response.url` - This is the url of the response.

4. `Response.headers` - This gives us the response from the http server and it has things like content type.
