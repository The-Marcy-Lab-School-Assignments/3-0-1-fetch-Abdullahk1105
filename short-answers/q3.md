# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer

The server sends the status code back to the client after a request was initiated. The point of the status code is to tell the user what went wrong. The most common status codes are 404.

Great explanation. One thing to note is the point of the status code isn't just to tell the user what went wrong but to indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled.
